* Create a folder for each lecture with similar name - L01 for lecture one, L02 for lecture two etc.

* Let each lecture have supporting Papers, Maths, Code and Notes in either ".ipynb" or ".pdf" format with references and useful links organized at the end.
* <h3>Papers:</h3> Find and upload original papers in pdf format. Also share the link for the paper. Give a brief overview of the contents and importance of each paper. Compile blogs or webpages explaining these papers. [Jupyter notebook - linking uploaded pdfs]
* <h3>Maths:</h3> Discuss and derive all relevant maths necessary to understand the lecture in more detail. Give steps, reasons for arriving at a particular equation. Any limits, assumptions etc may be documented. Use Equation Editor wherever possible. [pdf]
* <h3>Code:</h3> Give sample code pieces to understand the concepts, demonstrate understanding or plot a graph etc. Add self-explanatory notes inbetween code. [Jupyter notebook]
* <h3>Notes:</h3> Document in detail all the concepts reviewed in class. Document key points, reasons, intutive understanding, unanswered questions, applications etc. [Jupyter notebook]
